In this short post I describe briefly some ways to visualize pitch perception, tuning and temperaments, and speculate on how the process of solmization occurs.
$\newcommand{\Hz}{\text{ Hz}}$

_Pitch_ is a perceptual quality most associated to an identifiable frequency of a sound. The human hearing range is approximately described by the interval $[20 \Hz, 20000 \Hz ]$, but as an idealization we will extend the range infinitely. So, one may describe the _space_ of pitches as $\mathscr{P} = (0, \infty)$ (measured in a unit of frequency such as Hertz). Consider the equivalence relation $\sim_{\rm C}$ on $\msc{P}$ generated by the equivalences $\nu \sim_{\rm C} 2\nu$. Taking the quotient(for the unacquainted, this "divides" the set of all pitches into classes) yields the space of _pitch chromas_ or _pitch classes_ $\msc{P}\_{\rm C} = \msc{P} \mathbin{/} {\sim_{\rm C}}$. An example of a pitch class would be $[440 \Hz] = \\{\ldots, 110 \Hz, 220 \Hz,  440\Hz, 880 \Hz, \ldots\\}$.

<div class="music-card" style="width: 80%;">
	<div id="sheet-octaves">
		<code>
<!-- -->X: 1
<!-- -->M: C
<!-- -->L: 1
<!-- -->Q: 1/4 = 80
<!-- -->K: Amin
<!-- -->A,, | A, | A | A' |A''|]
		</code>
	</div>
	<div id="audio-octaves"></div>
</div>

<div class="fig-caption">Figure: 5 pitches in $[440 \, {\rm Hz}]$.</div>

Although each pitch in this example is different, the listener will feel a sense of "constancy" between each pitch. In this way, pitch chroma may be perceptually represented by a circle.

For those with absolute pitch, one essentially can categorize sounds into regions just as shown above. However, for the vast majority of people, pitch perception occurs on a more "relative" level, in which one does not recognize or categorize pitches by their "absolute" chroma.

## Relative <span style='color: red'>C</span><span style='color: orange'>h</span><span style='color: gold'>r</span><span style='color: green'>o</span><span style='color: blue'>m</span><span style='color: purple'>a</span>

Often one has an internalized "reference" pitch embedded in the mind which we refer to as a *tonic* or *tonal center*. Given such a tonic, one uses this as an "anchor" to reorient the pitch circle shown earlier. As such we might call the object to be perceived with a tonic _relative chroma_ as opposed to _absolute chroma_. We can describe relative chroma as follows. Consider the product $\mathscr{P}\_{\rm C} \times \mathscr{P}\_{\rm C}$ representing a perceived pitch chroma and underlying tonic. For example, an element of this product might be $(\text{chroma}, \text{tonic}) = ([550 \Hz], [440 \Hz])$.

Now one can quotient by the equivalence relation $\sim_{\rm RC}$ where $([\nu_1], [\nu_2]) \sim_{\rm RC} ([\lambda\nu_1], [\lambda\nu_2])$ for any constant $\lambda > 0$ to yield the space of relative chroma $\mathscr{P}\_{\rm RC} = (\mathscr{P}\_{\rm C} \times \mathscr{P}\_{\rm C}) \mathbin{/} {\sim_{\rm RC}}$. We denote the equivalence class of $([\nu_1], [\nu_2])$ by $[\nu_1] : [\nu_2]$.  Topologically, $\mathscr{P}\_{\rm RC}$ is also a circle. In contrast to absolute chroma, one need not refer to a specific unit of frequency to describe relative chroma, as they are represented by unitless quantities. For example, the expression $[3] : [2]$(the perfect fifth) is sensible regardless if it is in Hertz or some other unit. Relative chroma also satisfies a similar "doubling" principle, with equalities $[2x] : [y] = [x] : [y] = [x] : [2y]$.

The values each region depicted above centers around are in some sense "unnatural," and coming from the the equal division of regions for absolute chroma. An alternative method of providing labels to relative chroma is *just intonation*. An example of this is given by $7$-limit tuning wherein one may provide labels as follows:

<div style="overflow-x: auto;">
<table style="font-size: 13px;">
  <tr>
    <th>Label</th>
    <td>Do</td>
    <td>Di/Ra</td>
    <td>Re</td>
    <td>Ri/Me</td>
    <td>Mi</td>
    <td>Fa</td>
    <td>Fi</td>
    <td>Se</td>
    <td>So</td>
    <td>Si/Le</td>
    <td>La</td>
    <td>Li/Te</td>
    <td>Ti</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Chroma</th>
    <td>$[1] : [1]$</td>
    <td>$[15] : [14]$</td>
    <td>$[8] : [7]$</td>
    <td>$[6] : [5]$</td>
    <td>$[5] : [4]$</td>
    <td>$[4] : [3]$</td>
    <td>$[7] : [5]$</td>
    <td>$[10] : [7]$</td>
    <td>$[3] : [2]$</td>
    <td>$[8] : [5]$</td>
    <td>$[5] : [3]$</td>
    <td>$[7] : [4]$</td>
    <td>$[15] : [8]$</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

There are many possible ways of giving "ideal" values to each of the above labels, and there are many possible additional labels one can create to assign values to. An example of this is the splitting of the label "Fi/Se" to two labels "Fi" and "Se" in $7$-limit tuning. This splitting puts "Fi" closer to "Fa" and "Se" closer to "So" (the reason for this splitting comes down to the fact that major thirds in equal temperament are tuned "sharper" than in $7$-limit tuning).

## Tonic perception

The mechanism by which one establishes a tonic while listening to music does not seem to be completely clear, and may even be subjective in certain circumstances. It is clear, however, that this process is dependent on cultural expectations, e.g., the concept of a major key or minor key and the expectation for a piece to somewhat abide by the rules of Western tonality. With this in mind, the following might be an interesting way algorithmically determine the key(and thus tonic) from a given melody: one creates two $12 \times 12$ matrices of transition probabilities for notes(for both the major and minor modes) and then computes the probability of the melody implying each of the $24$ keys. One would then look for the option which yields the highest probability. I doubt such a comparative process is what is actually going on when one listens to music, as it would imply that some "absolute" information about each of the $24$ keys are stored in the brain. Another(more realistic?) approach might recognize specific intervallic patterns found in the major or minor scale to establish the tonic.
