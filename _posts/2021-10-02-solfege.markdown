The purpose of this post is an attempt at establishing a "perceptual theory of _solmization_". By a "perceptual theory", I mean a systematic way of describing how certain musical stimuli are perceived. Here, "solmization" refers to a specific type of system which "faithfully" labels or quantifies certain musical percepts; what this means specifically will become clear further on. 
$\newcommand{\Hz}{\text{ Hz}}$

## Pitch

_Pitch_ is a perceptual quality most associated to an identifiable frequency of a sound. Here, "identifiable" is used, as most sounds are a complex combination of pure tones, yet the brain only processes a single or few frequencies of such sounds to create the perception of pitch. Barring a few <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037859557990025X" target="blank">psychoacoustic phenomena</a>, in a musical context it is safe to associate a pitch with the numerical value of an identifiable frequency in a sound frequency.

The human hearing range is approximately described by the interval $[20 \Hz, 20000 \Hz ]$, but as an idealization we will extend the range infinitely. So, one may describe the _space_ of pitches as $\mathscr{P} = (0, \infty)$ (measured in a unit of frequency such as Hertz).

Consider the equivalence relation $\sim_{\rm C}$ on $\msc{P}$ generated by the equivalences $\nu \sim_{\rm C} 2\nu$. Taking the quotient(for the unacquainted, this "divides" the set of all pitches into classes) yields the space of _pitch chromas_ or _pitch classes_ $\msc{P}\_{\rm C} = \msc{P} \mathbin{/} {\sim_{\rm C}}$. An example of a pitch class would be $[440 \Hz] = \\{\ldots, 110 \Hz, 220 \Hz,  440\Hz, 880 \Hz, \ldots\\}$.

Although each pitch in this example is different, the listener might feel a sense of "constancy" between each pitch. If so, this is proof to the listener of the fact that $\mathscr{P}\_{\rm C}$ is _perceptually represented_, that is, $\mathscr{P}\_{\rm C}$ models some neurological percept(aptly called pitch chroma as well) in the brain.

One may even view pitch as being represented by $\mathscr{P}$ (a line) *topologically*, in which case the perception of pitch chroma should be represented by a circle ($\mb{S}^1$) topologically.

The perception of chroma can be further "colored" by an internal perception of a pitch chroma called a *tonic* or *tonal center*. Later in this post, I will discuss the processes by which we perceive a tonic from listening to music; for now, we define a tonic as a pitch chroma which embeds itself within the mind in such a way that it allows for the processing of percepts which I term _relative pitch chroma_.

We can describe relative chroma as follows. Consider the product $\mathscr{P}\_{\rm C} \times \mathscr{P}\_{\rm C}$ representing a perceived pitch chroma and underlying tonic. For example, an element of this product might be $(\text{chroma}, \text{tonic}) = ([550 \Hz], [440 \Hz])$. 

Now one can quotient by the equivalence relation $\sim_{\rm RC}$ where $([\nu_1], [\nu_2]) \sim_{\rm RC} ([\lambda\nu_1], [\lambda\nu_2])$ for any constant $\lambda > 0$ to yield the space of relative chroma $\mathscr{P}\_{\rm RC} = (\mathscr{P}\_{\rm C} \times \mathscr{P}\_{\rm C}) \mathbin{/} {\sim_{\rm RC}}$. We denote the equivalence class of $([\nu_1], [\nu_2])$ by $[\nu_1] : [\nu_2]$. In the future when necessary, I will distinguish between pitch chroma and relative chroma by using the term _absolute_ chroma for the former.

Topologically, $\mathscr{P}\_{\rm RC}$ is also a circle. In contrast to absolute chroma, one need not refer to a specific unit of frequency to describe relative chroma. For example, the expression $[3] : [2]$ is sensible regardless if it is in Hertz or some other unit. Relative chroma also satisfies a similar "doubling" principle, with equalities $[2x] : [y] = [x] : [y] = [x] : [2y]$.

### Just Intonation

This short digression will be the topic of a future post, but is worthy of mention here as well. The values each region depicted above centers around are in some sense "unnatural," and in fact come from the the equal division of regions for absolute chroma. An alternative method of providing labels to relative chroma is *just intonation*. An example of this is given by $7$-limit tuning wherein one may provide labels as follows:

<div style="overflow-x: scroll;">
<table style="font-size: 13px;">
  <tr>
    <th>Label</th>
    <td>Do</td>
    <td>Di/Ra</td>
    <td>Re</td>
    <td>Ri/Me</td>
    <td>Mi</td>
    <td>Fa</td>
    <td>Fi</td>
    <td>Se</td>
    <td>So</td>
    <td>Si/Le</td>
    <td>La</td>
    <td>Li/Te</td>
    <td>Ti</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Chroma</th>
    <td>$[1] : [1]$</td>
    <td>$[15] : [14]$</td>
    <td>$[8] : [7]$</td>
    <td>$[6] : [5]$</td>
    <td>$[5] : [4]$</td>
    <td>$[4] : [3]$</td>
    <td>$[7] : [5]$</td>
    <td>$[10] : [7]$</td>
    <td>$[3] : [2]$</td>
    <td>$[8] : [5]$</td>
    <td>$[5] : [3]$</td>
    <td>$[7] : [4]$</td>
    <td>$[15] : [8]$</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

There are many possible ways of giving "ideal" values to each of the above labels, and there are many possible additional labels one can create to assign values to. An example of this is the splitting of the label "Fi/Se" to two labels "Fi" and "Se" in $7$-limit tuning. Thinking of $\msc{P}\_{\rm RC}$ as a metric space, one finds that this splitting puts "Fi" closer to "Fa" and "Se" closer to "So" (the reason for this splitting comes down to the fact that major thirds in equal temperament are tuned "sharper" than in $7$-limit tuning).

## Function

We will define a *scale* to be a collection of elements in $\msc{P}\_{\rm C}$ along with two pieces of data:

1. an identified "central" chroma, which we term the *functional center*, and
2. a description of how each chroma acts in a "musical context," which we term the *functions* in the scale.

Using the labels described earlier, some examples of scales are:

- the scale $\\{D, E, F\sharp, G, A, B, C\sharp\\}$ with functional center $D$, known as $D$ major.
- the scale $\\{D, E, F\sharp, G, A, B, C\sharp\\}$ with functional center $F\sharp$, known as $F\sharp$ Phrygian.
- the scale $\\{E, F, G\sharp, A, B\flat, C, D\sharp\\}$ with functional center $E$, known as the $E$ Persian scale.
- the scale $\\{C, D, E, F\sharp, G\sharp/A\flat, B\flat\\}$ with functional center $C$, known as the $C$ whole tone scale.

The functions in a scale $S = \\{c_1, \ldots, c_n\\}$ can be roughly described by a transition matrix $f_{ij}$ describing the probability that some note with chroma $c_i$ is followed by a note with chroma $c_j$ in some musical context. Two scales with the same set of chromas and functional center might be functionally dissimilar. For example, in the classical idiom the "leading tone" $C\sharp$ in the $D$ major scale should have a higher probability of moving to $D$ than in the jazz idiom, where it is viewed as consonant with the functional center, and thus has less of a "need" to move to $D$.

I posit that the brain establishes a *tonal* center from determing the *functional* center in a musical context. To do this requires the use of cultural experience and expectations to best match heard stimuli into a collection of fixed scales the listener is familiar with. For example, listeners familiar with the major scale in Western music can automatically infer the *functional* implications of hearing a major-minor seventh chord (e.g. $\rm{C}^7$), and produce an internal *tonal* center which makes this a dominant seventh chord (e.g. $\rm{V}^7$ in $F$ major).

This is to say that the ideas of function and relative chroma are **not** the same, and only are connected in the fact that the brain attempts to equate the functional center of a scale with its internal tonal center.
